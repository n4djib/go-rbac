== TODOs ==
- try to use RunRule (check rule) from the engine 
	to allow the user to test if the engine can evaluate the rule
- make it a library
- optimizations
	what if we change the data into graph at init
		would that be faster?
	set the data as maps not slices
		would that be faster?
		the slice length is short
		Lookup Operations:
			Maps: O(1) average case for lookups by key - very fast
			Slices: O(n) for searching unless sorted (then O(log n) with binary search)
	what if we use pointers (copy by reference)
- a better optimization
	we don't evaluate the rule unless
	the rule leads to the role
	traverse the tree as if the rules are all true without ruunning them
	and check if the user has the required role
	if he has the reqiored role
	we traverse the tree
- can we use Goroutines to speed things up?
- change the JS (library) like you did with the GO version
	changed how it checks the setting of Roles and Permissions and RolePermissions
- isAllowed result should return a message indicating the reason for unauthorized
- are the rules able to run in both GO and JS
	?????????
- how to test in both languages at the same time
	maybe integration test where the JS tries the GO backend
- add a flag to enable debug mode
	to debug the engine and the rbac library
	to watch the decision making process
- create a UI relations visualizer and editor
	abstract enaugh
- provide a database schema in SQL (to aid clients in creation of the database)
- rules for Roles
	role: manager
		but the rule says manager of (group)
		maybe you are a manager if a condition applies
			like if your manager is absent
- write tests for the engines
- seperate engines to avoid installing goja or otto packages if not needed
- write a README.md file
- hox to version the libraries
- add doc.go file to the library package for godoc support
- create a CLI tool for the library (bubble tea + ssh)
	to create roles and Permissions and RolePermissions
-

- 


== DONE ==
	- when creating New rbac, at first pass a nil as an empty implementation of the interface
		and if it is empty don't use rules (and don't accept them in SetRbac)
	- add testing
	- need to improve error handling
	- you can add error state in struct
		why do this??




== Run & Testing ==
> go test ./rbac
> go test ./rbac -coverprofile=c.out
> go tool cover -html=c.out
> go test .\rbac\rbac_test.go
> go test .\rbac\rbac_integration_test.go -run TestWithEvalEngines
> go run ./examples/basic .

> cd rbac
> go test -v .

> cd engine
> go test -v .
